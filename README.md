### Introduction <a id="introduction"></a>

TP53 gene codes for the p53 protein – a transcription factor, which is an anti-oncogene (tumor suppressor) involved in signaling pathways of cellular activities. It controls the output of many biological processes: cell cycle arrest, senescence, DNA repair, and apoptosis either directly as a transcription factor or by interacting with other proteins adapting its response to the type of cellular stress signal received<!--[if supportFields]><span style='font-size:

oncology with a history that dates back to 1979 when p53 was discovered. The
p53 pathway is a complex cellular stress response network with multiple diverse
inputs and downstream outputs relevant to its role as a tumor suppressor
pathway. While inroads have been made in understanding the biology and
signaling in the p53 pathway, the p53 family, transcriptional readouts, and
effects of an array of mutants, the pathway remains challenging in the realm of
clinical translation. While the role of mutant p53 as a prognostic factor is
recognized, the therapeutic modulation of its wild-type or mutant activities
remain a work-in-progress. This review covers current knowledge about the
biology, signaling mechanisms in the p53 pathway and summarizes advances in

activated by a host of stress stimuli and, in turn, governs an exquisitely
complex anti-proliferative transcriptional program that touches upon a bewildering

diverse effects remains unclear. How can we interpret p53's disparate
activities and the consequences of its dysfunction to understand how cell type,
mutation profile, and epigenetic cell state dictate outcomes, and how might we
restore its tumor-suppressive activities in

### Conclusion<a id="references"></a>

Progress are been made in the discovery and application of biomarkers in clinical application - early screening, diagnosis, prognosis, recurrence monitoring, which prolong patient’s life, survival and improve their quality of life. There are advances in molecular biology to find new biomarkers with the right degree of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and reliability for cancer patients’ management.
